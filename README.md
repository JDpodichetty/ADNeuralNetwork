## Additional Information

For more hands on learning, try adding an additional hidden layer to the NN, or trying giving it different data for a different problem and tweaking it so it works. Additionally, try splitting the data into training and test sets to better determine model accuracy

For any questions with the code, please reach out to me at patricklang96 (at) gmail . com.
